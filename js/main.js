    "original":["There's a lot to like about this place. We went for Dine LA and enjoyed the steak and sorrel soup. Soooo umami yummy, especially if u like truffle.Fries were amazing too. I would probably pass on the foie gras--- too much fruit for me and hard to taste the main ingredient.Service was excellent, dine la included a kir and a bottle of fizzy water.Excellent selection of wines by the glass. To finish, we picked 3 small pieces of cheese and they were nicely paired with walnuts, calmyrna fig preserve, and warm bread.Fairly big portions of steak, leftovers are great for breakfast. I can't wait to go back for their cassoulet.... Happy to find good hearty French food in LA , finally!!!","So I have finally found my French Bistro in LA.  This small unassuming bistro has hit home runs for me each time I go.  Is there nothing more satisfying that 'Steak Frites'?  For me, an unabashed NO!.  It is my 'goto' meal.  L'assiette does it right every time.  Sous vide steak, la 'Coulotte' as it's called in French is their cut of choice.   Most know it as 'picanha' from the Brazilain steak houses.  It's the rump cap or top sirloin cap in English.  It is that piece of meat just above the tail on a steer.Cooked sous-vide and flash finished in a pan, sliced and napped with the most wonderful sauce.  French fries, another speciality, are some of the best in LA.Starts off with a choice of soup or salad, and when you think you are done, they come around with a second helping (piping hot) of 'steak frites'!  What a meal.  For $27...such a dealWine list is staggering in its diversity, albeit small, the quality is exceptional.Jacques, the owner, is there every night making the customers feel right at home.There are other items on this limited menu, and all are equally good. But my typical bistro is known for its steak frites, so I am sticking to that!!","High chair - yes (very clean too)Hubby and I miss eating out at nice places so we came here for dinner. Since we dined with our 11 month old, we tried to rush ordering, so we both ordered the truffle prefixed dinner. The sorrel soup was nice and tasty for a vegetarian soup. However, I like the richness of non-vegetarian soups more. The foie gras was drowning in sauce. Also, it was cut into smaller pieces and the smaller pieces cooked, so I could not really avoid the sauce. I should have asked if the foie gras was a smaller portion in the prefixe, but it slipped my mind. The salmon tartare was slightly fishy on my first bite. The steak that came out was on the tougher side. Some pieces were nice and tender though. The truffle sauce that came out with the steak was good. But not that much truffle flavor. Some of the fries tasted old. The profiteroles were the highlight of my meal and recommended.I would recommend ordering their regular steak menu and staying away from their more expensive prefixe as it is not worth it.","L'Assiette is in the former space of Colonial which was run by a charming woman.  Now there seems to be a more Japanese influenced minimalism that seems to open up the space. There is counter seating for single diners or people wanting a feeling of a tapas atmosphere &amp; tables that can be configured to admit larger parties. L'Assiette is astute in realising that the small kitchen can't do full spectrum French cooking  so the main dishes are beef steak, chicken, salmon, portobello mushroom for vegans. Appetizers are Salmon Tartare, smoked Trout w/ cod roe, foie gras. There is sorrel soup or Gem salad.  1)   Seared Foie Gras in a sweet, thick port-creme de cassis demi-glace sauce w/ shallots, dried figs, black currant. Confit of onion slow cooked &amp; almost as sweet as the demi-glace sauce.  Red raspberry coulis dotted the dish for more sweet fruit.  Foie might have been seared a minute too long, but not critically. Demi-glace &amp; the confit were both quite cloyingly sweet making me wish the confit d'oignon have a bit more gastrique to counter the thick cloying sweetness of the demi-glace sauce. 1a)   Monbazillac, Chateau La Gironie 2011 is like Haute Sauterne of nearby Bordeaux.  Muscadelle, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon grapes undergo 'pouriturre noble'/noble rot whereby a fungus grows on the late harvest grapes drawing moisture out of the grapes to concentrate the sugars left in the grape.  This sweet dessert wine is a warm golden yellow.  Nice scent &amp; flavour of apricot, honey, &amp; sweet figs. Finish is rather clean &amp; fresh w/ a light acidic note.  Good pairing since it was more restrained in its sweetness so not all was one strongly dulcet note.2)  Little Gem salad was a refreshing mixture of torn bronze &amp; green leaf lettuce, hearts of firm lettuce, peanuts, tomato slices, corn, heart of palm.  It is lightly dressed w/ only oil, vinegar, salt to help cleanse the palate after the sweet richness of the foie gras.  Textures are crisp, watery, moist, cooling to promote a refreshing interlude.2a)  Sauvignon Blanc, Vignobles Dourthe, Bordeaux 2014 was unusual for a Sauvignon Blanc from Bordeaux since I'm more used to a citrusy, lemon flavour w/ a bit of mild grassy scent.  Dourthe gave off scents of tropical fruits such as a bit of lychee, pineapple....more like Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand.  Flavours were more like pineapple, lemon curd. The finish was musky citrus peel, chalky, a bit of tongue raspy minerality &amp; acid.  This was an 'exotic' Sauvignon Blanc that shined even better w/ the subdued salad at the same time enlivening the fresh greens.3)  Steak Frites was lean, fibrous, chewy w/ a nice chaw like a sirloin.  Ordered it medium rare since over cooking steak can leave it dry &amp; tough.  It didn't have a very evident beefy taste, but the thickened 'house sauce' which seemed closer to a Sauce Bordelaise which may have red wine, fond de cuisine, butter, shallots made up for it. I ordered it w/ a supplement of Black Truffle 'shavings' which to me were more like small chips giving out a strong acidic, fermenting, forest humus fragrance.  My guess is that this might be enhanced by a bit of black truffle oil, although I could be mistaken.  However, for the price this Steak Frites was well executed.  The Pommes Frites were fried a golden brown, not over fried which can bring out bitterness.  3a)  Rhone varietal blend, Chateau de Montfaucon, Cote de Rhone 2012 is probably made mostly from typical blend of Syrah, Mourvedre, Grenache making for a very dark almost purplish red color.  Nice scent of black fruits like black berry, blue berry, dark cherry, bit of leather, cinnamon spice.  Flavours are again mellowed dark fruits, bit of resinous oak countered by mild tannin &amp; acid.  Finish is a light fruit w/ no major lingering tones.  With all the heavy black truffle savory smoky acid notes, I'm wondering if a stronger, oakier, more ammonia scented red Bordeaux would have stood up better to the amped up earthiness from the optional black truffle supplement.  4) Profiteroles were three Pate a Choux pastry used in cream puffs stuffed w/ vanilla ice cream drizzled w/ chocolate sauce &amp; sprinkled w/ white powdered sugar.  Nice classic old fashioned dessert to end the meal.  A small demitasse of Espresso was the perfect accompaniment w/ the contrast of bitter &amp; the sweet.My waitress was Iris who is from Ile Saint Louis, home of the famous glace/ice cream maker, Bertillon. She was most helpful in guiding me through the diifferent courses.  Coder, a recent employee of L'Assiette, was most welcoming in making me feel at home. We talked a bit of his recent arrival from the East Coast. His only lament about LA was that in many Korean BBQ restaurants the minimum is for two people when ordering so if you ever get a hankering for Korean BBQ but can't find a willing participant, let me know.  L'Assiette....good 4 stars. Excellent service &amp; good, limited menu, solid bistro French","Before I got here I had eaten 3 hours before. Wasn't sure if I was going to eat that much. I planned on sharing a plate, but I saw a plate of steak frites being served to another customer. I have to say, that plate looked delicious. I then ordered my own plate of steak frites. The meal was $27, it came with soup, fries, and steak. At first I thought it was a small amount for someone who would be really hungry, but then the waitress brought out another serving of fries and steak. The steak was tasty, and the sauce was pretty amazing. It was a lot of food. Overall the food was delicious, I would definitely go back.","This is an excellent place to go for date night that is a little off the beaten path. L'Assiette has mastered the art of Steak Frites and they know what they are good at so it is almost the only thing on the menu. The steak and friets are both oh so delicious &amp; cooked to perfection. They even bring them out in two rounds so that you can eat them at their best. There is a choice of sorrel soup or a small salad before and warm crusty bread for the table. I've chosen the sorrel soup ever time I've come and it is so good I can't imagine switching to the salad. Oh my latest trip to L'Assiette we had a voucher from Blackboard eats that included wine pairings and a choice of appetizer prior to the normal soup/salad choice and the famous entree. The wine pairings were fun but no more so than just ordering a bottle for the table. The appetizer was also good but honestly just made me fill up before the main event. It was fun to go all out with the deal but for the future I am happy with the standard. There is easy to find street parking within a few blocks of the restaurant.","Came here last night for a friends birthday dinner. It's pretty cute, on a busy corner on Melrose and La Brea. I am not the hugest fan of sous vide steak, nor French fries (I know, it's weird), so I wasn't suuuuper looking forward to it, but it was my good friend's bday so, you know. I saw they had a foie gras appetizer and that got me excited -- I was able to convince my husband to split the steak frites with me (an extra $10, but whatever) so we could have one portion of steak and fries each, and also a bit of the foie. Foie was way overly dressed with caramelized onions and fruity compote stuff. It was good with a bit of the bread (complimentary Bread and pesto oil was delicious) but on its own was not a well-conceived plate. Steak was tasty, gravy was bomb, and the fries have a great crispness to then that makes it so they hold up well in the sauce. Our server was a real sweetie (why did I say that?) and everything came out promptly and stuff.","+ service + meal quality + portion size+ ownerThe taste melts in your mouth. Just get the steak and frites trust me. Food is hot and seasoned to perfection. Half off late night menu.Sleek and intimate ambience. The owner comes around and checks on every table and he's mad cool.","Loved this place. The steak is good but I got a pretty sinewy piece and it was kind of chewy. Maybe that's how that cut is supposed to be. The fries are delicious also. And for $27 it's a great deal. The wines are all great. Service was very good albeit the restaurant gets busy and so be patient. It's not a fast-food spot. The managers and owners are all so polite! Definitely coming back.","EAT THIS: steak frites because, duhL'Assiette means 'the dish' in French. The restaurant is known for one dish: steak frites. And man, it is THE dish. The menu centers on the classic French prep of a grilled sirloin steak and pommes frites. It's served in two courses so steak and fries are as fresh as possible, when you're ready to inhale the whole plate in one go. Twice.The steak is so juicy and tender, cooked medium rare. The fries are well-seasoned and fried in beef tallow to a perfect crispiness. I couldn't get enough of the sauce. As for the appetizer, I chose the sorrel soup and really enjoyed how creamy and thick it is. To summarize, just be prepared to love everything about your meal.","I came here for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. We ordered the steak. I got it well done (I know judge me later, but I'm allergic to beef. I still eat it because how can I resist. LOL). I ordered well done, but it was more on the medium side. I ended up giving the uncooked pieces to my boyfriend. The steak was so soft and melt-in-your-mouth good. The fries are like belgium fries. The gravy on top is slightly tangy. The soup was so delicious. It reminded me of the cream soup you get at the curry house before a meal. We came by on a thursday and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Overall, I am pleased with the overall experience. But I wish they served chicken rather than salmon.","$25 for steak and fries, and with a choice of soup or salad. You get a refill of the steak and fries once you finish your first round. Steak was cooked perfectly--so tender and flavorful with the gravy.Tip: look for parking around the corner (off the main street) if you don't want to valet.","Came for Dine LA. What a wonderful experience. Our server Iris set the tone for a perfect meal. She was excellent as our hostess and server. She was very attentive to our needs (refilling our water glasses,  clearing the table, checking in on us) and made wonderful suggestions for food. The food was equally great. I enjoyed my steak which was cooked Rare, just the way I like it. The fries were crispy with a hint of beef flavor. We asked for additional gravy for the fries. The gravy is a must have. I thoroughly enjoyed the gravy. The sorrel soup was delicious, so glad I ordered the soup. The bread was warm and fresh served with pesto olive oil.I would definitely come back again.","Awesome restaurant, really. The valet was nice, and our waitress was awesome. We selected a Cab Sauvignon to compliment the steak and fries, and oh my! The best part was about halfway through the meal, the server came around with more steak! Too good!","Got the salmon frites and my gf got the steak frites. The only thing above average of those meals were the fries. The steak was medium well done but just didn't do it for all of us(3 on our table so 3 opinions). The salmon was ok and tender but have had better though. Overall for just 27$ it was ok and worth the buck. Got soup some bread fries and steak all for 27.O yea **PROS**The steak and fries is two servings actually. After your first round they bring another one**in my Dj Khaled**","Frânchement, I think this is a Yelp fail. It's rated very high for the general area. I left feeling quite shall I say,  comme ci comme ça. The service is ok. We ordered two glasses of different wines. I asked the waiter not to tell us which wine was which so that when it came to the table we could guess the difference between a $16 spanish rioja tempranillo and a $16 napa cab sauv. When the wine came to the table they told us exactly which wine was which. I reminded that I wanted them not to tell us the wine, but they didn't understand and acted strangely. It's not a big deal.When the steak frites came, I asked for mustard. A different waiter said 'give me a second'. Strange language for a restaurant of this caliber. Quel domage.I also don't like how upon recieving the second serving of steak, staff approach the table and, without speaking, writes a line on the table  to communicate to other staff members that we have already finished one plate of steak. They turn abruptly and leave without saying anything in the hopes to go unnoticed. It's creepy. I understand that communication is important between staff but this method feels like they have us in the pigpen and fattening us up for the kill! The steak was hard to cut, chewy and I doubt 'Nebraska's finest quality'. Fries are fine. Both salad and sorrel soup were ok, though shallow to be considered yelp highlights. Prices are high for what you get. Lastly, I don't like that the steak is covered in gravy. I think there is room for improvement on all fronts. Until that happens, oui won't be back.","Everyone should try this place at least once. I made a reservation via Yelp and was seated right away. Once I at down I ordered the steak and fries deal for $27. The meal comes with an appetizer along with two servings of steak and fries. I had the sorrel soup which was very flavorful and a bit tangy. The steak was cooked perfectly along with the fries. The streak was tender and juicy whilst the fries were perfectly crunchy. However I did feel the fries were a tad salty ,but that may be just me. Other than that it was a perfect meal. They also have a wide selection of wine.The only downside would be if you were going as a party of two. They put you in a really tight space in close proximity to other tables. This was a bit awkward because your close enough to hear other people's conversations. However the food was fantastic.","What a deal!!!!! The menu is simple....  there really is only one thing to get and that you should get and that's the steak frites. It comes with soup or salad and the steak frites entree comes out in 2 portions so that the steak is warm and the fries are fresh. What a good idea! The sorrel soup is bomb - I would definitely recommend it. The salad is also good and is more than just an ordinary side salad. The steak is cooked perfectly and the fries are delicious. The jus/gravy is addicting! I would ask for more on the side. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area or if you're craving some steak frites that won't break the bank.","Stumbled upon this place for dine la and it was truly a find. Their sorrel soup and steak with their truffle sauce is earth shattering delicious! If you don't believe me, Make absolutely sure to get the truffle sauce even though it costs a little more with it because it's just insanely good.My new obsession. Their frites however wasn't as good as CHurch and States but their steak with that truffle sauce is just so good that you don't care.This place...My new obsession","We will not visit again. Good French style steak and fries. Soup was excellent and salad had good ingredients but way too much vinegar. Menu is limited to steak frite and whatever the daily special is. Decent beer and wine selection. Tables are so close to each other that it is borderline uncomfortable due to a lack of privacy in conversation. Our waitress was nice but abandoned us in the last 20 minutes where I left my credit card on the table for her to see but she never stopped to check on us. Finally the host was nice enough to ask if we would like a check."],"originalConcat":" There's a lot to like about this place. We went for Dine LA and enjoyed the steak and sorrel soup.

I ordered well done, but it was more on the medium side. I ended up giving the uncooked pieces to my boyfriend. The steak was so soft and melt-in-your-mouth good. The fries are like belgium fries. The gravy on top is slightly tangy. The soup was so delicious. It reminded me of the cream soup you get at the curry house before a meal. We came by on a thursday and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Overall, I am pleased with the overall experience. But I wish they served chicken rather than salmon. $25 for steak and fries, and with a choice of soup or salad. You get a refill of the steak and fries once you finish your first round. Steak was cooked perfectly--so tender and flavorful with the gravy.Tip: look for parking around the corner (off the main street) if you don't want to valet. Came for Dine LA. What a wonderful experience. Our server Iris set the tone for a perfect meal. She was excellent as our hostess and server. She was very attentive to our needs (refilling our water glasses,  clearing the table, checking in on us) and made wonderful suggestions for food. The food was equally great. I enjoyed my steak which was cooked Rare, just the way I like it. The fries were crispy with a hint of beef flavor. We asked for additional gravy for the fries. The gravy is a must have. I thoroughly enjoyed the gravy. The sorrel soup was delicious, so glad I ordered the soup. The bread was warm and fresh served with pesto olive oil.I would definitely come back again. Awesome restaurant, really. The valet was nice, and our waitress was awesome. We selected a Cab Sauvignon to compliment the steak and fries, and oh my! The best part was about halfway through the meal, the server came around with more steak! Too good! Got the salmon frites and my gf got the steak frites. The only thing above average of those meals were the fries. The steak was medium well done but just didn't do it for all of us(3 on our table so 3 opinions). The salmon was ok and tender but have had better though. Overall for just 27$ it was ok and worth the buck. Got soup some bread fries and steak all for 27.O yea **PROS**The steak and fries is two servings actually. After your first round they bring another one**in my Dj Khaled** Frânchement, I think this is a Yelp fail. It's rated very high for the general area. I left feeling quite shall I say,  comme ci comme ça. The service is ok. We ordered two glasses of different wines. I asked the waiter not to tell us which wine was which so that when it came to the table we could guess the difference between a $16 spanish rioja tempranillo and a $16 napa cab sauv. When the wine came to the table they told us exactly which wine was which. I reminded that I wanted them not to tell us the wine, but they didn't understand and acted strangely. It's not a big deal.When the steak frites came, I asked for mustard. A different waiter said 'give me a second'. Strange language for a restaurant of this caliber. Quel domage.I also don't like how upon recieving the second serving of steak, staff approach the table and, without speaking, writes a line on the table  to communicate to other staff members that we have already finished one plate of steak. They turn abruptly and leave without saying anything in the hopes to go unnoticed. It's creepy. I understand that communication is important between staff but this method feels like they have us in the pigpen and fattening us up for the kill! The steak was hard to cut, chewy and I doubt 'Nebraska's finest quality'. Fries are fine. Both salad and sorrel soup were ok, though shallow to be considered yelp highlights. Prices are high for what you get. Lastly, I don't like that the steak is covered in gravy. I think there is room for improvement on all fronts. Until that happens, oui won't be back. Everyone should try this place at least once. I made a reservation via Yelp and was seated right away. Once I at down I ordered the steak and fries deal for $27. The meal comes with an appetizer along with two servings of steak and fries. I had the sorrel soup which was very flavorful and a bit tangy. The steak was cooked perfectly along with the fries. The streak was tender and juicy whilst the fries were perfectly crunchy. However I did feel the fries were a tad salty ,but that may be just me. Other than that it was a perfect meal. They also have a wide selection of wine.The only downside would be if you were going as a party of two. They put you in a really tight space in close proximity to other tables. This was a bit awkward because your close enough to hear other people's conversations. However the food was fantastic. What a deal!!!!! The menu is simple....  there really is only one thing to get and that you should get and that's the steak frites. It comes with soup or salad and the steak frites entree comes out in 2 portions so that the steak is warm and the fries are fresh. What a good idea! The sorrel soup is bomb - I would definitely recommend it. The salad is also good and is more than just an ordinary side salad. The steak is cooked perfectly and the fries are delicious. The jus/gravy is addicting! I would ask for more on the side. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area or if you're craving some steak frites that won't break the bank. Stumbled upon this place for dine la and it was truly a find. Their sorrel soup and steak with their truffle sauce is earth shattering delicious! If you don't believe me, Make absolutely sure to get the truffle sauce even though it costs a little more with it because it's just insanely good.My new obsession. Their frites however wasn't as good as CHurch and States but their steak with that truffle sauce is just so good that you don't care.This place...My new obsession We will not visit again. Good French style steak and fries. Soup was excellent and salad had good ingredients but way too much vinegar. Menu is limited to steak frite and whatever the daily special is. Decent beer and wine selection. Tables are so close to each other that it is borderline uncomfortable due to a lack of privacy in conversation. Our waitress was nice but abandoned us in the last 20 minutes where I left my credit card on the table for her to see but she never stopped to check on us. Finally the host was nice enough to ask if we would like a check.","concepts":[{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"home runs","score":1,"offset":773}],"types":[""],"support":16483,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Home_run"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"cheese","score":1,"offset":430}],"types":[""],"support":5289,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"French","score":1,"offset":656}],"types":[""],"support":1106,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_cuisine"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"walnuts","score":1,"offset":470}],"types":[""],"support":1054,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walnut"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"French fries","score":1,"offset":1294}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":853,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_fries"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"foie gras","score":1,"offset":2190}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":477,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foie_gras"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"truffle","score":1,"offset":140}],"types":[""],"support":469,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truffle"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"Sous","score":1,"offset":950}],"types":[""],"support":110,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sous"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"profiteroles","score":1,"offset":2700}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":55,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Profiterole"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"cassoulet","score":1,"offset":616}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":50,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassoulet"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"second helping","score":1,"offset":1455}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Album"],"support":24,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Helping"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"steak frites","score":1,"offset":1811}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":16,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steak_frites"},{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"top sirloin cap","score":1,"offset":1113}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Food"],"support":12,"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Top_sirloin"}],"parsedConcepts":[{"url":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Home_run","name":"home runs","support":16483,"polarity":"negative","subjectivity":"subjective","text":"So I have finally found my French Bistro in LA.

There is counter seating for single diners or people wanting a feeling of a tapas atmosphere &amp; tables that can be configured to admit larger parties. L'Assiette is astute in realising that the small kitchen can't do full spectrum French cooking  so the main dishes are beef steak, chicken, salmon, portobello mushroom for vegans. Appetizers are Salmon Tartare, smoked Trout w/ cod roe, foie gras. There is sorrel soup or Gem salad.  1)   Seared Foie Gras in a sweet, thick port-creme de cassis demi-glace sauce w/ shallots, dried figs, black currant. Confit of onion slow cooked &amp; almost as sweet as the demi-glace sauce.  Red raspberry coulis dotted the dish for more sweet fruit.  Foie might have been seared a minute too long, but not critically. Demi-glace &amp; the confit were both quite cloyingly sweet making me wish the confit d'oignon have a bit more gastrique to counter the thick cloying sweetness of the demi-glace sauce. 1a)   Monbazillac, Chateau La Gironie 2011 is like Haute Sauterne of nearby Bordeaux.  Muscadelle, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon grapes undergo 'pouriturre noble'/noble rot whereby a fungus grows on the late harvest grapes drawing moisture out of the grapes to concentrate the sugars left in the grape.  This sweet dessert wine is a warm golden yellow.  Nice scent &amp; flavour of apricot, honey, &amp; sweet figs. Finish is rather clean &amp; fresh w/ a light acidic note.  Good pairing since it was more restrained in its sweetness so not all was one strongly dulcet note.2)  Little Gem salad was a refreshing mixture of torn bronze &amp; green leaf lettuce, hearts of firm lettuce, peanuts, tomato slices, corn, heart of palm.  It is lightly dressed w/ only oil, vinegar, salt to help cleanse the palate after the sweet richness of the foie gras.  Textures are crisp, watery, moist, cooling to promote a refreshing interlude.2a)  Sauvignon Blanc, Vignobles Dourthe, Bordeaux 2014 was unusual for a Sauvignon Blanc from Bordeaux since I'm more used to a citrusy, lemon flavour w/ a bit of mild grassy scent.  Dourthe gave off scents of tropical fruits such as a bit of lychee, pineapple....more like Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand.  Flavours were more like pineapple, lemon curd. The finish was musky citrus peel, chalky, a bit of tongue raspy minerality &amp; acid.  This was an 'exotic' Sauvignon Blanc that shined even better w/ the subdued salad at the same time enlivening the fresh greens.3)  Steak Frites was lean, fibrous, chewy w/ a nice chaw like a sirloin.  Ordered it medium rare since over cooking steak can leave it dry &amp; tough.  It didn't have a very evident beefy taste, but the thickened 'house sauce' which seemed closer to a Sauce Bordelaise which may have red wine, fond de cuisine, butter, shallots made up for it. I ordered it w/ a supplement of Black Truffle 'shavings' which to me were more like small chips giving out a strong acidic, fermenting, forest humus fragrance.  My guess is that this might be enhanced by a bit of black truffle oil, although I could be mistaken.  However, for the price this Steak Frites was well executed.  The Pommes Frites were fried a golden brown, not over fried which can bring out bitterness.  3a)  Rhone varietal blend, Chateau de Montfaucon, Cote de Rhone 2012 is probably made mostly from typical blend of Syrah, Mourvedre, Grenache making for a very dark almost purplish red color.  Nice scent of black fruits like black berry, blue berry, dark cherry, bit of leather, cinnamon spice.  Flavours are again mellowed dark fruits, bit of resinous oak countered by mild tannin &amp; acid.  Finish is a light fruit w/ no major lingering tones.  With all the heavy black truffle savory smoky acid notes, I'm wondering if a stronger, oakier, more ammonia scented red Bordeaux would have stood up better to the amped up earthiness from the optional black truffle supplement.  4) Profiteroles were three Pate a Choux pastry used in cream puffs stuffed w/ vanilla ice cream drizzled w/ chocolate sauce &amp; sprinkled w/ white powdered sugar.  Nice classic old fashioned dessert to end the meal.  A small demitasse of Espresso was the perfect accompaniment w/ the contrast of bitter &amp; the sweet.My waitress was Iris who is from Ile Saint Louis, home of the famous glace/ice cream maker, Bertillon. She was most helpful in guiding me through the diifferent courses.  Coder, a recent employee of L'Assiette, was most welcoming in making me feel at home. We talked a bit of his recent arrival from the East Coast. His only lament about LA was that in many Korean BBQ restaurants the minimum is for two people when ordering so if you ever get a hankering for Korean BBQ but can't find a willing participant, let me know.  L'Assiette....good 4 stars. Excellent service &amp; good, limited menu, solid bistro French","Came here last night for a friends birthday dinner. It's pretty cute, on a busy corner on Melrose and La Brea. I am not the hugest fan of sous vide steak, nor French fries (I know, it's weird), so I wasn't suuuuper looking forward to it, but it was my good friend's bday so, you know. I saw they had a foie gras appetizer and that got me excited -- I was able to convince my husband to split the steak frites with me (an extra $10, but whatever) so we could have one portion of steak and fries each, and also a bit of the foie. Foie was way overly dressed with caramelized onions and fruity compote stuff. It was good with a bit of the bread (complimentary Bread and pesto oil was delicious) but on its own was not a well-conceived plate. Steak was tasty, gravy was bomb, and the fries have a great crispness to then that makes it so they hold up well in the sauce. Our server was a real sweetie (why did I say that?) and everything came out promptly and stuff.","EAT THIS: steak frites because, duhL'Assiette means 'the dish' in French. The restaurant is known for one dish: steak frites. And man, it is THE dish. The menu centers on the classic French prep of a grilled sirloin steak and pommes frites. It's served in two courses so steak and fries are as fresh as possible, when you're ready to inhale the whole plate in one go. Twice.The steak is so juicy and tender, cooked medium rare. The fries are well-seasoned and fried in beef tallow to a perfect crispiness. I couldn't get enough of the sauce. As for the appetizer, I chose the sorrel soup and really enjoyed how creamy and thick it is. To summarize, just be prepared to love everything about your meal.","We will not visit again. Good French style steak and fries. Soup was excellent and salad had good ingredients but way too much vinegar. Menu is limited to steak frite and whatever the daily special is. Decent beer and wine selection. Tables are so close to each other that it is borderline uncomfortable due to a lack of privacy in conversation. Our waitress was nice but abandoned us in the last 20 minutes where I left my credit card on the table for her to see but she never stopped to check on us. Finally the host was nice enough to ask if we would like a check."],"walnuts":["There's a lot to like about this place. We went for Dine LA and enjoyed the steak and sorrel soup. Soooo umami yummy, especially if u like truffle.Fries were amazing too. I would probably pass on the foie gras--- too much fruit for me and hard to taste the main ingredient.Service was excellent, dine la included a kir and a bottle of fizzy water.Excellent selection of wines by the glass. To finish, we picked 3 small pieces of cheese and they were nicely paired with walnuts, calmyrna fig preserve, and warm bread.Fairly big portions of steak, leftovers are great for breakfast. I can't wait to go back for their cassoulet.... Happy to find good hearty French food in LA , finally!!!"],"French fries":["So I have finally found my French Bistro in LA.  This small unassuming bistro has hit home runs for me each time I go.  Is there nothing more satisfying that 'Steak Frites'?  For me, an unabashed NO!.  It is my 'goto' meal.  L'assiette does it right every time.  Sous vide steak, la 'Coulotte' as it's called in French is their cut of choice.   Most know it as 'picanha' from the Brazilain steak houses.  It's the rump cap or top sirloin cap in English.  It is that piece of meat just above the tail on a steer.Cooked sous-vide and flash finished in a pan, sliced and napped with the most wonderful sauce.  French fries, another speciality, are some of the best in LA.Starts off with a choice of soup or salad, and when you think you are done, they come around with a second helping (piping hot) of 'steak frites'!  What a meal.  For $27...such a dealWine list is staggering in its diversity, albeit small, the quality is exceptional.Jacques, the owner, is there every night making the customers feel right at home.There are other items on this limited menu, and all are equally good. But my typical bistro is known for its steak frites, so I am sticking to that!!","Came here last night for a friends birthday dinner. It's pretty cute, on a busy corner on Melrose and La Brea.
